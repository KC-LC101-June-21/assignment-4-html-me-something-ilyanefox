         <p>I use yarn to create textile art and accessories by weaving and knitting. I've made a lot of 
            different products with yarn, including wall hangings, throw pillows, blankets, hats, scarves &amp; face masks.
            You can follow the ball of yellow yarn through all of the projects where I've used it.</p>

               <h3>Woven Wall Hanging</h3>
               <img src="images/IMG-3633.JPG" alt="Woven Wall Hanging" width="600">
               <p>
                  This is the first project where I used the yellow yarn. I used a small tapestry loom to make
                   this wall hanging that was inspired by a Mexican
                  textile that I saw in an antique store. I love tapestry weaving because you can easily
                  create different shapes and textures using different colors and types of yarn. I decided to 
                  learn how to weave after seeing beautiful Peruvian textiles at the Brooklyn Museum. It is my dream
                  to travel to Peru and visit one of the few weaving communities that are still left there.

               <h3>Woven Textile for a Pillow</h3>
               <img src="images/IMG-2889.JPG" alt="Loom with fabric being woven" width="600">
               <p>
                  My second project with the yarn was a woven fabric to make a throw pillow. I used a rigid-heddle loom 
                  for this project. The benefit of using this kind of loom is that you can make larger pieces of fabric.
                  It is also good if you have large parts of repeating patterns. The design for this fabric was inspired by a colorful basket
                  that I found at an antique store. I like how the yellow color pops alongside the red and grey.

               <h3>Knitted Scarf</h3>
               <img src="images/IMG-7376.jpg" alt="Scarf with yellow color blocks" width="600">
               <p>
                  For my third project, I knitted a long scarf with blocks of yellow, pink &amp; taupe. I love knitting,
                  because it is fascinating to me how many different things you can make out of one strand of yarn. One difference between
                  knitting and weaving is that you can shape the fabric as you knit, so you don't have to sew pieces together. Another difference
                   is how long it takes to make something. Weaving is quick, but this scarf took a month to make!

               <p>
                  During quarantine, I made face masks for friends and family. I added designs with yarn to make them more fun to wear, 
                  like this one with yellow yarn that says &quot;hello&quot;!
